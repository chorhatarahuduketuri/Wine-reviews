# Wine Reviews Dataset Analysis
https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews

As part of my on going interest in knowing how to pick better wine, I'm going to see what I can determine from the Wine Reviews dataset available from Kaggle. Since it contains a score for each wine, along with 12 other features (including one text description), I will see if I can use it to find out what attributes of wine tell me that it's a 'better' wine. Why is this dataset better than the last two - it's features are things I can find out about wine _without_ having to take it to a labratory! 

Also, I'll build a model to try to classify them accurately according to score, and consider putting it in an app I can take to the shop with me.

Now that the project is complete to my satisfaction, I can succinctly summarise that the most important factors for me to look for in wine that I buy from Sainsburys is that it: 

1. Is relatively expensive  
2. Contains sulphides  
3. Has relatively high alcohol content  

Which is entirely sufficient a set of criteria for me to pick something nice on the way to my friend's house.

What I've learned from this Wine Reviews project, as well as in general about ML: 
- Jupyter notebooks are great for exposition, but not good for presenting all the messy parts of work. 
- Jupyter notebooks are not very good in version control, due to the way they change. 
- I need to have a better investigate-data prep-model building cycle. 
- I need to practice my EDA presentations, as they could be clearer.
