# Wine Reviews Dataset Analysis
https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews

As part of my on going interest in knowing how to pick better wine, I'm going to see what I can determine from the Wine Reviews dataset available from Kaggle. Since it contains a score for each wine, along with 12 other features (including one text description), I will see if I can use it to find out what attributes of wine tell me that it's a 'better' wine. Why is this dataset better than the last two - it's features are things I can find out about wine _without_ having to take it to a labratory! 

Also, I'll build a model to try to classify them accurately according to score, and consider putting it in an app I can take to the shop with me.
