    "### The Solution(s)?\n",
    "1. I could do what I did with the other wine related datasets and train a tree model to get which are the ~3-5 most important factors, and what ranges they should lie in. While I think this will work - and I intend to do it - it also tends to always end up focussing on only one particular ordered set of questions with the same answers; country A, variety B, price C, etc. which doesn't tell me anything about good wines from country F (and I assume that country F must have some good wine or other? Additionally, since several of the features are nominal, non-ordinal data, but they have been represented ordinally, decision trees will not be able to select features out of order from their representation, and this will limit the usefulness of the trained models regardless of how accurate they are. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. I could use some sort of relatively simple model (e.g. linear regression) and try to determine from the coefficients what features are important, and what values are better, but attempts to determine feature relevance in that way usually fail, as coefficients do not correlate with feature importance. I could use some sort of feature selection to further reduce the number of features I have, and make the result easier to understand somehow? The effectiveness of that is unclear, but unlikely. Then again, [scikit-learn's `SelectFromModel`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel.html \"scikit-learn docs\") exists to do just that - automatically - so maybe that's worth a look. This still doesn't actually tell me what _values_ of features mean good wine though, so I probably won't do this. \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that I've got the results, I'll first take a look at them and any graphics of their estimators and coefficients that seem relevant. "
